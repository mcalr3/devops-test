# DevOps Test for Cintra

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to do our technical test. There are no trick
questions here, we are just looking for you to do what you do best and provide
us an example of your work in a simplified context.

Please don't modify this repo - please make a local copy with your changes. You
can either send us the completed repo as a tar/zip or send us a link to your
repo.

## Technical Test
Here we have a basic hello-world style dotnet-core application. The exercise is
to deploy it to the cloud as you would do for any production service, as well as
explaining decisions that are made along the way.

### Requirements
The only requirement is to deploy it to a cloud provider (of you choice) with a
continuous deployment pipeline.

## Technical Questions
Please answer the following questions as part of your submission.

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? Why that length of time?
2. Describe why you made the choices that you did. What would you do differently?
3. What did you enjoy most/least about this exercise?
4. What is the most useful bit of tech you have used recently?
